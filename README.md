<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm <a href="https://www.karimov.berlin/" target="_blank">Evgenii Karimov</a>👋</h1>

I'm currently a data engineer in Delivery Hero based in Berlin.  
Instruments I use everyday: AWS stack - Redshift, Glue, various RDS databases, Lambda; Spark, Python, SQL, Airflow, Looker, Tableau, BigQuery.  
Curious about modern approaches to design and architect datawarehouses.  
I am working on some side projects, learning new things and trying to stay on top of modern fast-pace changing technologies.

⚡️ A Few Quick Facts:  
🧐 Learning about serverless architectures, distributed systems, and a bit of ML.  
👨‍💻 Most of my projects are available on Github.  
📝 I regulary write articles on my blog.  
💬 Ping me about Python, Go, Terraform, and cloud stuff.
