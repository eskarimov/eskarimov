<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm <a href="https://www.karimov.berlin/" target="_blank">Evgenii Karimov</a>👋</h1>

I'm a data engineer based in Berlin.  
Instruments I use:  
- Real-time streaming products - [Spark Streaming](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka).
- MPP systems - [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), [Pivotal Greenplum](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb) and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/).
- SQL-on-Hadoop engines - [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Hive](https://github.com/apache/hive), [Presto](https://github.com/prestodb/presto).
- NoSQL systems - [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo).
- Orchestration tools - [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [DBT](https://github.com/dbt-labs).  

Curious about modern approaches to design and architect data-platforms.

I contribute to Apache Airflow, and also work on side projects,
learning new things and trying to stay on top of modern fast-pace changing technologies.

⚡️ A Few Quick Facts:  
🧐 Learning about serverless architectures, distributed systems, and a bit of ML.  
📝 I ~~regularly~~ write articles on my blog.  
💬 Ping me about Data Engineering topics, Python, Terraform, and cloud stuff.  
🏄 Like travelling and surfing.
